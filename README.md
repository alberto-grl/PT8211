# PT8211
Forked from https://github.com/sipeed/TangPrimer-20K-example/tree/main/PT8211

The Sipeed example was not working. There was a huge distorsion in the audio output because setup time of data pin of PT8211 was not respected.
Added stereo support. A sine wave is emitted on one channel, a sawtooth on the other.
